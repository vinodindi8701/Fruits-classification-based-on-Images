# Fruits-classification-based-on-Images
In this project we used different classification algorithms to classify fruits in 3 diffent classes
1. Apples
2. Bananas
3. Oranges

In this repository I have uploaded the un-supervised and self-supervised models.

I have use Autoencoder and K-means clustering for the classification purpose.
